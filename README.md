This is a school project. Feel free to watch my application, tho you cant run it as the servers are no longer running.

The application is build on Node.js and Express.

The main focus of the application is to render a page with fetched github issues of a specific user accunt.
Then I use githubs webhook to tell the server if something uppdates. 
Server then update the client thrue a socket connection in realtime.
